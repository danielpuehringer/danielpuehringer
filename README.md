My name is Daniel and I'm a Master's Student at [TU Wien](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/facts-and-figures/). I'm a passionate nature lover🌳, socializer🥳, interrailer🚄, historian📔, and lover of the Austrian Coffee House culture☕.

### 👨‍💻 Education:
I study [Software Engineering & Internet Computing](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/software-engineering-and-internet-computing/). I'm interested in building larger Software which faces challenges in terms of e.g. availability, scalability and security. However I'm not only interested in Software Engineering & Distributed Systems, but also into several aspects of Business Informatics and lately also Artificial Intelligence (mainly Machine Learning).

Prior to my current Master's I finished my Bachelor's at [Hagenberg Campus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5AcemGh4fM&ab_channel=FHO%C3%96Hagenberg) (University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria) after which I worked in the area of website and web application development.

### 💻 Work experience: 
Besides my current work as a Freelance Website Developer I have gained 3.5 years of professional experience in several larger & smaller IT-companies.
After interning at the public company MicroFocus (now [opentext](https://www.microfocus.com/de-de/home)) and a 6-month internship at [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) in [Barcelona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBd68OeynE&t=48s&ab_channel=DynatraceLife) I wanted to pursue a gap year in the smaller company [elements](https://www.elements.at/de) and gain work experience instead of immediately continuing with a Master's Degree.
Due to the COVID-Outbreak I adapted this plan and relocated to beautiful Vienna, where I continued my path as a Fullstack Developer and then transitioned back to academia with my current Master's programme.

### 💡 My most recent personal projects: 
1. **Ridesharing platform / mobility service provider** (e.g. Uber, Deliveroo, UberEats, ...)
Implemented data management, business logic, platform scalability of a sophisticated enterprise application using state-of-the-art technologies for distributed systems.
**Technologies used:** _Java, JPA, Redis, MongoDB, SQL, Docker, RabbitMQ, ApacheFlink_
3. Decentralized basic electronic mail service
Implemented logic for multiple multithreaded servers to exchange encrypted E-Mail messages.
**Technologies used:** _basic concepts of TCP and UDP socket communication, multithreaded applications (incl. Java Thread Pools), Encryption/Decryption via AES & RSA, Hashing (HMAC; SHA), Remote Procedure Calls (Java RMI)_
